            <p>The First Cleveland Masjid is one of the oldest Muslim institutions in the U.S. Founded in 1937 by Al Hajj Imam Wali Akram, an African American. The First Cleveland Masjid remains a testimony of the powerful attraction that Americans have towards the beliefs and culture of Islam.</p>

            <p> Al Hajj Imam Wali Akram, born Walter Reese Gregg in Caldwell Texas on August 04, 1904 was introduced to Islam in the early 1920s and went on to establish the First Cleveland Masjid in 1937 with the creation of the Muslim 10 Year Plan. The mission of the First Cleveland Masjid was to entertain and educate the Muslim community. Imam Wali Akram continued to spread the Islamic message of peace, love and unity, which made the First Cleveland Masjid the milestone of peace making among the diverse religious groups across greater Cleveland.</p>

            <p>Over the years, the First Cleveland Masjid persevered, demonstrating consistency and growth. In fact, the Masjid was instrumental in the development of several other Islamic Institutions throughout the Greater Cleveland area. Since the genesis of the First Cleveland Masjid, this historic institution resided at the following locations in Cleveland, Ohio before relocating in 1975 to its current edifice at 3613 East 131st Street:
